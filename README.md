# FootballFixtures

### Description
This repo contains a football application which gets data from the [api](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart)
The application has a fixture screen to display all the fixtures available for that day,
A competitions screen to show all the available tournaments in session available on the api.

It also has a standings screen to show the league rankings of the teams.

##### NB: Given it is a free token you can only view a few competitions

There is also another fixtures screen to show the matches peculiar to a single competition and shows matches from the present day up to one week.
Finally we have a list of teams screen, which segues to a players list screen.
Application was built programmatically in Swift.
